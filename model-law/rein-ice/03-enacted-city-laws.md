## Adapting for Your City

**Population Considerations:**
- Large cities: Broader policy, dedicated oversight
- Medium cities: Focus on police department policies
- Small cities: May be city council resolution rather than ordinance

**Local Factors to Address:**
- Existing police cooperation agreements (287(g), etc.)
- State preemption laws (some states ban sanctuary policies)
- Local political landscape
- Immigrant community size and visibility

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Research your city's current policies
2. Identify gaps compared to these models
3. Draft ordinance language adapted to local code
4. Build coalition of supporters
5. Present to city council with community backing
