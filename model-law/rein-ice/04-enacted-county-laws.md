## Key Elements for County Ordinances

1. **Detainer Policy** - Will the county honor ICE detainers? Under what circumstances?
2. **Warrant Requirement** - Require judicial warrant, not just administrative detainer
3. **Notification** - Will ICE be notified of release dates?
4. **Jail Access** - Can ICE conduct interviews in county facilities?
5. **Data Sharing** - What information flows to federal agencies?
6. **Training** - How are employees trained on the policy?
