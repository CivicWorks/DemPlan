## Advocating for State-Level Laws

**Advantages:**
- Covers entire state uniformly
- Preempts hostile local jurisdictions
- Stronger legal standing
- More resources for implementation

**Challenges:**
- Requires state legislative majority
- May face gubernatorial veto
- Some states have anti-sanctuary preemption laws

**Strategy:**
1. Build statewide coalition
2. Document local successes
3. Draft legislation based on these models
4. Identify legislative champions
5. Mobilize constituent pressure
