## Key Policy Components

When evaluating or drafting sanctuary policies, look for these elements:

| Component | What It Does | Strength Level |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **No voluntary ICE cooperation** | Prohibits using local resources for federal enforcement | Basic |
| **No immigration status inquiries** | Protects community members from profiling | Basic |
| **Warrant requirement for detainers** | Requires judicial warrant, not just ICE request | Strong |
| **287(g) prohibition** | Bans agreements that deputize local officers | Strong |
| **Safe zones** | Protects schools, hospitals, courthouses | Strong |
| **Notification requirements** | Alerts community to enforcement actions | Strong |
| **ICE property ban** | Prohibits use of public property for enforcement | Strong |
| **Private prison ban** | Prohibits contracts with detention facilities | Strongest |

## Legal Foundations

These policies rest on established legal principles:

1. **10th Amendment**: States can't be compelled to enforce federal law
2. **Anti-commandeering doctrine**: Federal government can't require local participation
3. **Local police power**: Cities and states control their own law enforcement
4. **Plyler v. Doe**: Schools cannot deny education based on immigration status

---

## Responding to Opposition

**"Sanctuary policies are illegal"**
> The Supreme Court's anti-commandeering doctrine confirms states and localities cannot be forced to participate in federal enforcement.

**"This makes us less safe"**
> Studies show sanctuary policies improve public safety by encouraging immigrant communities to report crimes and cooperate with police.

**"We'll lose federal funding"**
> Courts have blocked most attempts to withhold funding. Consult legal counsel for your specific situation.

**"We're a nation of laws"**
> These policies don't obstruct federal enforcement - they simply decline to volunteer local resources for federal operations.
