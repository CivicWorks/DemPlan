# Defunding and dismantling ICE

**Question**: ICE agents murdered another person today, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was assisting two women the agents had pepper sprayed. I want to put together a plan to get ICE defunded and dismantled before the next election. That would include identifying pressure points: corporations, faith-based organizations, grassroots groups, political donors, local law enforcement, state government officials, etc. Then it would involve thinking through campaigns, toolkits, communications and reach, and so on. What do you think the best way to start putting something like that together would be?

**Response:** Here’s a thoughtful way to start building a **strategic plan to pressure for defunding and dismantling ICE** in the wake of the latest tragedy in Minneapolis — where a 37-year-old ICU nurse was fatally shot by federal immigration agents during an enforcement operation, an event that has sparked national outcry and protests.

Organizing a strategy like this is a serious political and social effort, and it’s important to ground it in strategy, research, coalition-building, and lawful civic engagement. Below is a structured approach you can tailor to your context and organizational resources.

## 🧠 Step 1 — Define Your Clear, Achievable Objective

Before outreach and campaigns, be very precise about what you want:

- **Primary goal:** Defund and dismantle ICE.
- **Intermediate goals:**
    - Reduce or remove specific ICE enforcement programs (e.g., Operation Metro Surge).
    - Redirect DHS appropriations away from ICE toward community support, due process, and humane immigration systems.
    - Increase transparency and accountability for enforcement actions.
    - Establish alternatives to harmful immigration enforcement models.

Clear goals will guide tactics and help you measure progress.

## 📊 Step 2 — Research and Pressure Mapping

To build a campaign that can influence policy, you must identify the *actual levers of power* and the audiences whose views and actions matter.

### 1. **Policy and Funding Structures**

- Who funds ICE?
    - ICE is funded through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget, appropriated by Congress.
    - Defunding efforts must focus on appropriations committees and legislative votes. ([5 Calls](https://5calls.org/issue/dhs-budget-ice-defund/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- What legal structures authorize ICE?
    - DHS was created in 2003; ICE is part of DHS and could be restructured or eliminated with legislative action. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolish_ICE?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Pressure points to research:**

- House and Senate appropriations leaders
- Members of the budget and homeland security committees
- Key swing votes in legislative chambers

### 2. **Coalitions and Movement Partners**

Map groups and constituents who may align with your goals:

- **Immigrant rights groups:** NILC, CASA, etc. ([NILC](https://www.nilc.org/action/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Racial justice organizations**
- **Faith-based justice networks**
- **Civil liberties groups**
- **Labor and healthcare worker organizations**
- **Youth and campus activism groups**

Understanding overlapping networks will help build broad coalitions.

### 3. **Corporate and Financial Pressure**

Many corporations have immigration enforcement contracts:

- Private prison companies manage detention centers. ([National Immigrant Justice Center](https://immigrantjustice.org/research/policy-brief-cut-the-contracts-its-time-to-end-ices-corrupt-detention-management-system/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Advocacy around contract termination, transparency disclosures, and divestment can exert leverage.

### 4. **Local/Government Officials**

Not all opposition must target national offices. Cities and states can:

- Withdraw cooperation agreements with federal enforcement (sanctuary policies).
- Pass resolutions calling for oversight or changes to ICE.
- Support legal challenges to enforcement practices.

## 🎯 Step 3 — Build Campaign Infrastructure

Once you understand the landscape, build the organizational scaffolding:

### ✏️ Messaging Framework

Develop clear messaging that resonates beyond activists:

- Human stories (e.g., the loss of a healthcare worker) help move public sentiment. ([People.com](https://people.com/va-doctor-remembers-alex-pretti-37-year-old-icu-nurse-killed-by-ice-exclusive-11892030?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Data on systemic harms and alternatives (e.g., immigration reform, humane enforcement). ([American Friends Service Committee](https://afsc.org/news/what-you-need-know-about-call-abolish-ice?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Create tailored messages for:

- Legislators
- Faith communities
- Corporate stakeholders
- Grassroots supporters

### 📣 Communications and Outreach Plan

Plan how you will reach and mobilize supporters:

- Social media campaigns with hashtags and shareable graphics
- Email newsletters with actions and updates
- Press outreach and opinion pieces
- Community forums and listening sessions

---

## ✊ Step 4 — Tactical Campaign Elements

Here are concrete tools and campaign channels you can develop:

### 🗳 Congressional Pressure

- **Direct constituent engagement:** phone calls, emails, lobby visits
- **Letter-writing campaigns** to committees that allocate DHS funding
- **Coalition sign-on letters** from organizations

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Engagement

- **Rallies, vigils, and marches** that keep public attention on the issue
- **Story sharing campaigns** — uplifting voices of impacted communities

### 📢 Digital Advocacy

- TikTok / Instagram / X campaigns that educate and mobilize
- Online petitions targeted at specific legislators or corporate contracts

### 🪧 Faith and Values Organizing

Many faith networks focus on justice and human dignity:

- Interfaith letters to political leaders
- Prayer vigils with a call for policy change

### 📚 Toolkits and Resources

Create downloadable toolkits with:

- Sample emails to elected officials
- Social media graphics + sample posts
- Talking points and FAQs

---

## 🧠 Step 5 — Build Longevity and Feedback Loops

Successful movements are sustained, not episodic.

### 📈 Track Metrics

Track:

- Communications sent to legislators
- Changes in public statements by officials
- Legislative actions (bills introduced or hearings called)
- Media mentions and public awareness

### 🔄 Feedback and Adaptation

- Hold regular debriefs with your organizing team
- Adjust messaging based on what resonates
- Share updates with supporters to keep momentum

## ⚖️ A Note on Strategy and Realism

National abolition of a federal agency requires legislative power or massive political shifts. Current calls for abolition vary in approach; some aim for structural change followed by humane alternatives rather than total elimination absent a plan for core functions like criminal investigation or border security. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolish_ICE?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Even if wholesale abolition is a long-term goal, **defunding, oversight measures, stronger accountability, legal restrictions on enforcement practices, and robust alternatives** are achievable intermediate steps that can save lives and build broader political support.

## 🕊 Final Thought

Organizing toward systemic change — especially in response to tragedies like the killing of Alex Pretti — deserves a clear plan, coalition support, and concrete tactics rooted in lawful civic action.
