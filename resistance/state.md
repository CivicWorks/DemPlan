## Federal Tax Withholding / Escrow Strategies

### Active Legislation (as of late 2025)

#### RECOURSE Act - Multi-State Effort

**States with introduced legislation:**
- **New York** - Sen. Jessica Ramos, Asm. Micah Lasher (10 cosponsors)
- **Maryland** - Del. David Moon (Majority Leader)
- **Connecticut**
- **Pennsylvania** 
- **Wisconsin** (unlikely to pass - GOP legislature)
- **Washington** (drafting for next session)

**Mechanism:** Withhold funds owed to federal government if feds withhold state funds in violation of court orders or unlawfully withhold congressionally appropriated funds.

**What can be withheld:**
- Federal tax withholdings from state employee paychecks (~$5.39B/year for NY alone)
- Grant payments owed back to federal government

### Tax Escrow Proposal (Broader Approach)

**Source:** [Chris Armitage - Medium, Nov 2025](https://medium.com/@carmitage/experts-say-blue-states-can-stop-paying-federal-taxes-theres-precedent-9cda0ce41215)

#### Mechanism
1. State legislature requires ALL employers to redirect federal withholdings to state escrow (not just state employees)
2. Funds held until federal government passes independent audit
3. Audit criteria: spending follows congressional appropriations, operations within statutory authorization, enforcement respects due process and court orders
4. Pass audit = funds release. Fail = billions stay in state accounts

#### Historical Precedent
- **WA HB 2712 (2010)** - Republican bill proposing similar mechanism, died in committee
- **Cannabis legalization** - States stopped enforcing federal drug law; feds lacked enforcement capacity
- **REAL ID** - 25 states opposed, deadline extended 9 times (2008→2027)

#### Legal Risks
- Supremacy Clause challenges
- McCulloch v. Maryland precedent
- Author argues enforcement capacity matters more than rulings
